In this project, I written computer bots to play the War simulation game using Greedy (Minimax with cut-off depth = 1), Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning algorithms. The red color is Union and blue color is Confederacy. The original idea of this game is from[1]. The game is played on the graph. Each node (a city) contains resources. The goal of this game is to capture more resources than the opponent. The image below shows the initial state of the map in the simulation game, namely when no player has yet to capture any resources. The game ends when both players cannot make any more moves.
